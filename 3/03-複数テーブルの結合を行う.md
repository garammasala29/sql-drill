# 複数のテーブルの結合を行う(2)

余計なテーブルを結合しないか注意。

結合はあくまで2つのテーブル間で行われている
```sql
SELECT
  d.DepartmentName AS 部門名
, AVG( s.Amount ) AS 部門別平均給与額
FROM
  Salary AS s
    JOIN
  BelongTo AS b
    ON s.EmployeeID = b.EmployeeID
      JOIN
    Departments AS d
      ON b.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY
  d.DepartmentName
;
```

## Railsの場合
```ruby
```
----
```sql
SELECT
  c.CategoryID
, c.CategoryName AS カテゴリ名
, SUM( s.Quantity ) AS 数量合計
FROM
  Sales AS s
    JOIN
  Products AS p
    ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
      JOIN
    Categories AS c
      ON p.CategoryID = c.CategoryID
GROUP BY
  c.CategoryID
;

SELECT
  SUM( s.Quantity ) AS 合計数量
, p.PrefecturalID
, p.PrefecturalName AS 県名
FROM
  Sales AS s
    JOIN
  Customers AS c
    ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      JOIN
    Prefecturals AS p
      ON c.PrefecturalID = p.PrefecturalID
GROUP BY
  p.PrefecturalID
;

SELECT
  MAX(s.Quantity) AS 最大数量
, cc.CustomerClassID
, cc.CustomerClassName AS 顧客クラス名
FROM
  Sales AS s
    JOIN
  Customers AS c
    ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      JOIN
    CustomerClasses AS cc
      ON c.CustomerClassID = cc.CustomerClassID
GROUP BY
  cc.CustomerClassID
;

SELECT
  SUM( s.Quantity ) AS 合計数量
, p.PrefecturalID
, p.PrefecturalName
FROM
  Sales AS s
, Customers AS c
, Prefecturals AS p
WHERE
  s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
  AND
  c.prefecturalID = p.PrefecturalID
GROUP BY
  p.PrefecturalID
;

SELECT
  MAX(s.Quantity) AS 最大数量
, cc.CustomerClassID
, cc.CustomerClassName AS 顧客クラス名
FROM
  Sales AS s
, Customers AS c
, CustomerClasses AS cc
WHERE
  s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
  AND
  c.CustomerClassID = cc.CustomerClassID
GROUP BY
  cc.CustomerClassID
;
```
