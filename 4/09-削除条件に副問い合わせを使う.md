# 削除条件に副問い合わせを使う
`UPDATE`における副問合せの利用と同様
```sql
DELETE
FROM
  Products
WHERE
  ProductID NOT IN (
    SELECT
      ProductID
    FROM
      Sales
  )
;

-- 相関副問い合わせを使って書き換え
DELETE
FROM
  Products
WHERE
  NOT EXISTS
  (
    SELECT
      'X'
    FROM
      Sales
    WHERE
      Products.ProductID = Sales.ProductID
  )
```
